YOUR TASK:
         Complete the function relationalOperators() that compares two integers a and b. Print:
           "a is greater than b" if a is greater than b
           "a is less than b" if a is less than b
           "a is equal to b" if a equals b
         Each output should be followed by a newline character.

CODE:
     class Solution{
    static void relationalOperators(int A,int B){
        if(A>B){
            System.out.println(A+" is greater than "+B);
        }else if(A<B){
            System.out.println(A+" is less than "+B);
        }else{
            System.out.println(A+" is equal to "+B);
        }
    }
}

RESULT:
      Input: a = 90 b = 5
      Output: 90 is greater than 5.
